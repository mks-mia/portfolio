# Personal Portfolio Website (Modified Version)

This is my personal portfolio website, built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**. It serves as a digital showcase of who I am, what I do, and the skills I've developed.

## What’s New in This Version

This “modified” portfolio builds on the original static site by introducing:

1. **Enhanced Tech Stack** – Integrated JavaScript (ES6+), Bootstrap 5, and organized assets (`vendor`, `icons`).
2. **Modern Layout** – Clean, multi-section design: About, Education, Skills, Projects, Contact.
3. **Interactive UI** – Bootstrap components and JS-based navigation for a smoother user experience.
4. **Better Asset Management** – Structured directories and scalable layout ideal for future updates.

Aimed to transform a simple showcase into a polished, maintainable, and interactive developer portfolio.
